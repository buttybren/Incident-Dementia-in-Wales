# Project outline

We will be looking at risk factors associated with incident dementia in the ageing population of Wales using the CFAS data. 
This was done by reviewing two waves of the CFAS data for Wales and analysing their differences. Common factors associated with dementia across the two waves were identified and reported.

# Abstract

# Introduction and background
Dementia is one of the major causes of death, dependency, and disability among older people globally. It is estimated that by 2030, there will be a million people in the UK with dementia. Wales is a country in the UK with the oldest population. In this article, we used data from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) Wales study to investigate a number of factors and their association with incident dementia in a population-based cross-sectional study in Wales.

# Objective
1.	To examine the association between lifestyle factors and the incidence of dementia.
2.	To examine the association between demographic factors and the incidence of dementia in Wales.
3.	To examine the association between previous medical history and the incidence of dementia
The study aims to gain insight into the risk factors associated with dementia in Wales.

# Method
The CFAS Wales dataset was used for the study. Two waves of data were analysed to capture incidence in the second wave. Incident dementia was determined by having an AGECAT score of 3. People without a dementia diagnosis at the start of the study were included in the analysis.

# Results
Older people, people who have suffered from TIA, depression, epilepsy, frequent headaches, and have had a head injury, are at a higher risk of incident dementia in Wales compared to those who have not experienced these conditions.

# Conclusion
Identifying risk factors at the National level provides a useful tool for planning.
